You output **unified diffs only** for the exact files I list. Keep public APIs stable unless critical. Chunk if needed and stop with READY FOR CONTINUE.

Instructions:
- Apply minimal, surgical changes to fix issues (nullability, disposing, token usage, EF best practices).
- No prose unless I say "explain".
- If a file doesnâ€™t exist, include a `new file mode` diff.

Now wait for my file list.
