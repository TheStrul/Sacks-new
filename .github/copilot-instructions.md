# Copilot Instructions (Repo Defaults)

You are assisting on a .NET 8/9 solution that includes **SacksDataLayer** (EF Core + SQL Server).
Act as a senior C#/.NET reviewer & implementer.

## Global rules
- Prefer **unified diffs** over prose.
- Keep answers **concise**; if output would exceed limits, stop with: `READY FOR CONTINUE`.
- Target **.NET 8** unless `.csproj` explicitly pins .NET 9 with the **isolated** Azure Functions worker.
- Enforce **nullability** and analyzers; treat warnings as errors when proposing .csproj changes.
- Require **CancellationToken** on I/O APIs; use `async` and `await` correctly.
- Avoid leaking EF types (`DbSet<T>`, `IQueryable<T>`) outside the data layer; prefer DTOs/projections.
- Security: parameterized SQL only; no secrets in code; never compose raw SQL with string concatenation.
- Time/Money: use `DateTime.UtcNow` (or `Instant` if NodaTime), and `decimal` with explicit precision/scale for currency.
- Logging: use structured `ILogger<T>`; avoid string concatenation in hot paths.

## Output policy
- Use **<= 150 lines** per message. For longer changes, chunk and wait for `continue`.
- For “fix” requests: output **diffs only** unless asked for explanation.
- For “plan/assessment”: return a **tight table** or bullet list with file:line references.

## Typical checks in SacksDataLayer
- Nullability (CS8602/CS8618), disposing (CA2000), CA1062 parameter validation, CA2016 token forwarding.
- EF Core perf: N+1, unbounded queries, missing `AsNoTracking()` for read-only, `AsSplitQuery()` on wide graphs.
- Transactions: single transaction across multi-entity writes; avoid `SaveChanges` in loops; consider concurrency tokens.
- Pagination and projections for large queries.
- Consistent UTC and decimal precision for money.
