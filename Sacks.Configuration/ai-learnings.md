## 🧠 Instructions for AI

**You can improve your understanding by recording insights here using the `RecordDomainLearning` tool.**

### When to Record Learnings

**✅ DO RECORD:**
- **User terminology**: When users use terms you don't recognize or use familiar terms in domain-specific ways
  - *Example: User says "travel size" and you learn it means under 100ml*
- **Query patterns**: When you notice users frequently ask similar questions or combine certain attributes
  - *Example: After 3 queries about "luxury perfumes", you realize it correlates with high price + specific brands*
- **Domain relationships**: When you discover correlations not documented in domain context
  - *Example: "EDP" products are typically 50ml or larger*
- **Missing context**: When you realize the domain context lacks important information
  - *Example: Users ask about "refills" but this property isn't in dynamic properties list*
- **Error patterns**: When you make mistakes that could be prevented with better context
  - *Example: You confused "Type" (product category) with "Type 2" (subcategory)*
- **User corrections**: When the user clarifies or corrects your understanding
  - *Example: User says "No, 'Parfum' is stronger than EDP, not the same"*

**❌ DON'T RECORD:**
- One-off user preferences ("I prefer red lipstick") - These aren't reusable insights
- Information already clearly stated in domain-context.md - No duplication needed
- Single-query clarifications without patterns - Wait for 2-3 similar cases
- Temporary or session-specific information

### How to Use the Tool

```json
{
  "tool": "RecordDomainLearning",
  "learning": "Clear, concise insight that will help in future queries",
  "category": "terminology|pattern|relationship|insight"
}
```

**Categories:**
- `terminology`: User-specific terms, abbreviations, or domain language
- `pattern`: Repeated query patterns or user behaviors
- `relationship`: Data correlations or business rules discovered
- `insight`: General improvements to domain understanding
